# Avantos Code Challenge

This is my submission for the Avantos Code Challenge. This project can be run locally by downloading the repo and using the scripts listed in the `package.json`. Make sure to also download and run this test server: https://github.com/mosaic-avantos/frontendchallengeserver. If using data from the Avantos API (https://api.avantos-dev.io/docs#/operations/action-blueprint-graph-get), then uncomment `blueprintVersionId` in `getActionBlueprintGraph.ts`. For the server request to work, you must also create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add a `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable with the appropriate base URL for the test server (ex. `"http://localhost:3000"`) or the base URL for the Avantos API if you have access (`"https://api.avantos-dev.io"`).
